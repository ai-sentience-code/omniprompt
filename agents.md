# Instructions for Agents

This repository contains a minimal Chrome extension that sends a single prompt to multiple LLM web pages.

* Use **two spaces** for indentation across JavaScript, HTML and CSS files.
* Keep the extension self contained and avoid external dependencies.
* When adding or modifying supported sites, update both the `manifest.json` host permissions and the `defaultSites` list in `options.js`.
* Test changes by loading the unpacked extension in Chrome.

Pull request guidelines:

1. Provide a concise title.
2. Summarise the purpose of the PR and mention any manual testing performed.
